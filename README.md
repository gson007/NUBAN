## NUBAN Code Implementation
Implementation of NUBAN in Javascript with dummy account Number

## Introduction
The CBN released the Guidelines on Nigeria Uniform Bank Account Number(NUBAN) scheme in August, 2010, to achieve uniform customer bank account numbering structure among all Deposit Money Banks in Nigeria, within 9 months. NUBAN has great potentials to resolve the observed problems with electronic payments in Nigeria, as many of
them are related to specification of wrong beneficiary account numbers

However, a number of operational modalities need to be released to the market by the CBN, to facilitate smooth and successful implementation of the scheme. Accordingly, the Cheques and ACH Working Group (CAWG) met and deliberated on these issues and hereby recommend the foregoing.
